# jose

A JOSE implementation in Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpdavis/jose.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpdavis/jose)

### Principles

This is a JOSE implementation that is meant to be simple to use, both on and off of AppEngine.


### Thanks

This library is based heavily on the work of the guys over at [PyJWT](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt).
